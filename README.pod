=head1 NAME

App::Monport - Monitor network ports for changes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # generate the configuration file
 $ monport localhost scanme.nmap.org

 # compare against the configuration file
 $ monport

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Use this module to find out whether some new ports have been opened or
existing ones have been closed. New open ports mean bigger attack surface and
consequently higher security risk. On the other hand if a port gets closed it
might indicate a problem with a network service.

The application works by comparing the actual state of ports (open or closed)
with the expected state defined in the configuration file.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

See F<bin/monport> for how to use these functions.

=head2 create_config($conf_file, @hosts)

Create configuration file F<$HOME/.monport.yml> containing hosts with
corresponding open ports. This file will be used as the expected list of
open ports in the consequent scans.

=head2 compare_config($conf_file)

Compare list of open ports defined in the F<$conf_file> with the current list
of open ports. Print newly opened or closed ports.

=head2 scan_ports($host, $verbose)

Return an array reference containing list of ports open on $host.

=head2 nmap_path()

Return absolute path to nmap executable or die.
