=head1 NAME

App::Monport - monitor network ports for changes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Run this to see available sub-commands (use -h to get help):

 $ monport

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Use this application to find out whether some new ports have been opened (or
existing ones have been closed). More open ports mean bigger attack surface and
consequently higher security risk.

First you should run a base scan, like:

 $ monport base --name localhost 127.0.0.1

Later on check whether some changes in ports' state took place:

 $ monport diff --name localhost

To check regularly create a cronjob like:

 * 21 * * 5      monport --diff --name localhost --email jdoe@example.com
